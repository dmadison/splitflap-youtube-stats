# Split-Flap YouTube Statistics Extras

The files in this folder are 'extras', used in the creation of the video for the project. They are published here in the hope that someone else may find them useful.

### channel_demo.py

Shows channel name and subscriber count on the split-flap display, loading the channel info from text file instead of from the API. Note that this requires `splitflap_youtube_stats` for handling the text parsing and split-flap output.

### youtube_info_local.py

Fetches and saves YouTube data from the API into a local text file for later retrieval. This was used in place of live data for filming the associated YouTube video, so that number values would not change between different camera angles.
